3. compared actual returns vs. predicted returns

Conclusion: From 2015-about late 2017, there isn't a noticeable difference between the two. From late 2017 to mid 2018, actual returns performed slightly better than strategy returns. However, from then, the strategy returns greatly surpass the actual returns.
